#Welcome to ROS2 installation

If you reached this github, you are trying to run ROS2 in Mac with a processor M1. Yeah, me too.
After a lot of reading I decided to document this process just in case it works!

Anyway, let's get it started by downloading UTM to create a virtual machine in Mac and Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) .
It is a bit tricky to find the Desktop ARM version for Ubuntu 22.04.2, hence here is the link:

Make sure you download the ARM version, otherwise it won't run in the Mac M1 architecture.
